#Text-Mining
==================================================================================================
The purpose of this project is to propose a statistical model to develop a practical system for emails
filtration using text messages collection dataset including spam and real texts. The dataset is semi-structured data. 
Each text is labeled as spam or ham that is used for machine learning and predicting the spam text messages in emails.
